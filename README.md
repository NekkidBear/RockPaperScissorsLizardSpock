Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock game as described in the Big Bang theory.

This is a fan-game interpretation of Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock, as described in "The Big Bang Theory". Many online and mobile games use similar systems as their main mechanic, so I wanted to make sure I understand the engine behind it.

The rules are fairly simple. This is an expansion of the traditional Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Each player selects an option (and chooses the appropriate hand gesture), and then the round is scored. Ties are typically handled by re-playing the round. 

from the rules on the fan wiki: https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/Rock,_Paper,_Scissors,_Lizard,_Spock

* Scissors cuts Paper
* Paper covers Rock
* Rock crushes Lizard
* Lizard poisons Spock
* Spock smashes Scissors
* Scissors decapitates Lizard
* Lizard eats Paper
* Paper disproves Spock
* Spock vaporizes Rock
* (and as it always has) Rock crushes Scissors
